Restful python API- placeholder while i learn WCF- for android app

taken from
http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/designing-a-restful-api-with-python-and-flask

reason i don't use restful module from flask to build this api quickly and efficiently?
coz i don't understand decorators and marshalling in python that well and this simplified form is enough for my needs
right now
